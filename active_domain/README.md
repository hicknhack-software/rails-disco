# Active Domain

A framework that allows to write a domain server, that processes commands and creates events.

You should have exactly one domain server for your Rails Disco applications.
The domain runs in a domain specific database environment. This helps to make sure no other process interferes with the domain.

Have a look at the [rails-disco](https://github.com/hicknhack-software/rails-disco/wiki) documentation on Github for more details.
